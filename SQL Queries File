-- Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

-- 1. Select all customers
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- 2. Select all orders
SELECT * FROM orders;

-- 3. Inner Join: customers with their orders
SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- 4. Left Join: show all customers even if no orders
SELECT c.name, o.total_amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- 5. Aggregation: total/average per customer
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent, AVG(total_amount) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- 6. Subquery: orders by USA customers
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA'
);

-- 7. Create a View: high spenders
CREATE VIEW high_spenders AS
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 500;

-- 8. Query the View
SELECT * FROM high_spenders;

-- 9. Create Index
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
